DESCRIPTION OF DATA IN FILE file.mat AND file_mys.matPulse length = 10 microsecondsChirp bandwidth = 10 MhzSampling rate = 12 Msamples/secWe are simulating 40 pulses at an RF of 10 GHzand a PRF of 25 kHz, giving a PRI of 40 usec.The range window limits are 12 to 38 usec.The unambiguous velocity interval is 375 m/s.The range window starts at 1.8 km.The range window ends at 5.7 km.The unambiguous range interval is 3.9 km.There are 4 targets with the following parameters:  range=  2.3 km, SNR=     10 dB, vel=   -112.5 m/s  range=  2.7 km, SNR=     20 dB, vel=   -56.25 m/s  range=  3.1 km, SNR=     10 dB, vel=     37.5 m/s  range=  3.1 km, SNR=     20 dB, vel=    93.75 m/s
